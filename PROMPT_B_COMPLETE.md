# Prompt B Complete - Data Pipeline Implementation

## ✅ Completed Tasks

All data pipeline and feature engineering functionality from **Prompt B** has been successfully implemented.

## 🔧 Implemented Features

### 1. Data Loading (`load_seed()`)
- Loads products, sales, inventory, and social trends from CSV files
- Gracefully handles missing files with empty DataFrames
- Parses dates automatically for time-series processing

### 2. SKU-Level Aggregation (`aggregate_by_sku()`)
Aggregates sales data by:
- Date
- Store ID
- Channel (store/online)
- SKU

Aggregation includes:
- Total units sold
- Promo flag (max if any promo that day)
- Average price
- Product attributes (style, color, size, category)

### 3. Attribute-Level Aggregation (`aggregate_by_attribute()`)
Aggregates sales by **attribute triplet**:
- Color name
- Size
- Style description

Plus:
- Date, store, channel
- Aggregated units, promo flags, price

### 4. Feature Engineering

#### a) Moving Averages (`add_moving_averages()`)
- **7-day MA**: Recent trend baseline
- **28-day MA**: Longer-term seasonal trend
- Calculated per store-SKU or store-attribute group
- Uses rolling window with min_periods=1 to handle sparse data

#### b) Promo Rate (`add_promo_rate()`)
- 7-day rolling average of promo_flag
- Represents % of days with promotions
- Captures promo intensity over time

#### c) Price Index (`add_price_index()`)
- Current price / average price per group
- Values > 1.0: higher than average (negative demand impact)
- Values < 1.0: lower than average (positive demand impact)

#### d) Seasonality Features (`add_seasonality_features()`)
- **Day of year**: sin/cos encoding for annual cycles
- **Day of week**: sin/cos encoding for weekly patterns
- Cyclical encoding preserves continuity (Dec 31 → Jan 1)

#### e) Stock Coverage (`add_stock_coverage()`)
- `stock_coverage`: on_hand inventory / 7-day avg sales
- `incoming_coverage`: on_order inventory / 7-day avg sales
- Identifies stockout risk and overstocking

#### f) Trend Signals (`add_trend_signals()`)
- Merges social media trend scores by date and color
- Averages multiple trend sources per day
- Fills missing values with neutral 0.5

### 5. Feature Matrix Extraction (`get_feature_matrix()`)
Converts engineered DataFrame to numpy matrix for ML models:
- Auto-selects numeric features
- Handles missing values (fills with 0)
- Returns both matrix and feature names for interpretability

**Default features**:
- units_sold, promo_flag, price
- ma_7d, ma_28d
- promo_rate_7d, price_index
- day_sin, day_cos, dow_sin, dow_cos
- stock_coverage, incoming_coverage (optional)
- trend_score (optional)

### 6. Main Pipeline (`load_features()`)
Returns structured dictionary:
```python
{
    "sku_features": DataFrame,      # SKU-level aggregated features
    "attribute_features": DataFrame, # Attribute-level aggregated features
    "metadata": {
        "products": DataFrame,
        "trends": DataFrame,
        "inventory": DataFrame
    }
}
```

### 7. Integration with Model Service
Updated `model.py` to:
- Use real engineered features from pipeline
- Apply what-if scenario adjustments:
  - Price delta with elasticity model
  - Promo flag (+20% uplift)
  - Color trend boost (custom per color)
- Generate forecasts based on 7-day MA baseline
- Return structured responses with real attribute data

### 8. Enhanced Explainability (`explain.py`)
Dynamic feature attribution based on actual data:
- Price impact (from price_index)
- Promo contribution (from promo_rate)
- Trend signals (from social data)
- Seasonality magnitude
- Stock constraints (negative if low inventory)
- Momentum (7-day vs 28-day MA ratio)

## 🧪 Comprehensive Test Suite

Added `test_pipeline.py` with tests for:
- ✅ Seed data loading
- ✅ SKU aggregation (validates row counts and columns)
- ✅ Attribute aggregation (validates triplet grouping)
- ✅ Moving average calculation (validates MA values)
- ✅ Seasonality features (validates sin/cos ranges)
- ✅ Price index (validates ratio calculations)
- ✅ Promo rate (validates rolling average)
- ✅ Feature matrix extraction (validates shape and columns)
- ✅ Full integration test (validates end-to-end pipeline)

## 📊 Example Feature Output

For a single SKU over time, the pipeline generates:

```
date       | store | sku   | units_sold | ma_7d | ma_28d | promo_rate | price_index | day_sin | stock_coverage | trend_score
-----------|-------|-------|------------|-------|--------|------------|-------------|---------|----------------|-------------
2025-07-01 | DXB01 | A1001 | 6          | 6.0   | 6.0    | 0.0        | 1.0         | 0.52    | 8.3            | 0.63
2025-07-02 | DXB01 | A1001 | 5          | 5.5   | 5.5    | 0.5        | 0.9         | 0.53    | 7.2            | 0.63
2025-07-03 | DXB01 | A1001 | 7          | 6.0   | 6.0    | 0.33       | 1.0         | 0.54    | 6.2            | 0.75

```python
from app.services.data_pipeline import load_features

class Request:
    horizon_days = 30
    store_ids = ["DXB01"]
    skus = ["A1001"]
    level = "attribute"

features = load_features(Request())
# Returns sku_features, attribute_features, and metadata
```

### Extract feature matrix for ML:
```python
from app.services.data_pipeline import get_feature_matrix

X, feature_names = get_feature_matrix(df)
# X: numpy array, feature_names: list of column names
```

### Test the pipeline:
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/test_pipeline.py -v
```
